Cards Lecture 3
---------------

Using what I've learned about HTML, CSS, JS and JQ, I've create a cards app that will do the following:

- cardFromTop: first card in array
- cardFromBottom: last card in array
- drawRandom: get a random index in the deck and show on DOM
- showDeck: displays the full deck in order on the screen
- hideAll: clears the DOM
- click on a card and it will tell you on what card you clicked
- shuffleDeck: randomizes the deck

TODO:
-----

- "hit me" button: adds cards drawn from top of deck
- with each hit, display the player's total (add up numbers from the cards drawn, like Blackjack)
